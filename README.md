# It's the new...

## Summary
- A fun art project made one rainy day in London
- Pulls data from two APIs, a random word and a random color (name + hexcode), to create an interesting outcome to say the very least.

## Technology
### API

- [Random Word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home)
### Font

## Inspiration
- The inspiration came from the song ["Kennedy Killed the Hat" by Buck 65](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Pfp6Npi1KA1h9FS7ttotD?si=f5cb15189ac84297), which features the lyric: `Clear is the new black`.
- Also a little knod to the [Beastie Boys](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Mu1MYdE414HeybYSms5KK?si=c6f294668b244f92).
